# The "remote" summary.
#
# This represents the game summary that gets generated to an external URL,
# as "https://spleefx.net/stats/<a tracked game ID>".
#
# This summary URL is generated after each game, and sent to all players in that game.
#
# The remote summary contains the following information:
# - A table of all the players, who won and who lost
# - Overall statistics, such as the total blocks mined and total game time.
#
# To add a custom mode, add the mode key under the "Modes" section.
#
# The generated URL entirely depends on the header + player format below. Make sure
# that the number of elements inside the 'Header' is exactly equal to the number of elements
# inside the 'PlayerFormat', otherwise the page will render incorrectly.
#
# You will also notice 'BackgroundURL' which is the background image to display in the background.
# Recommended background size: 1920x1080
#
# You can input multiple image URLs, in which case the it would pick randomly which image
# to display.
#
# As well as "ServerIP". This will simply appear in the page right under your fancy arena name.
